## Welcome to Swift++

Swift++ is a fork of Swift to develop an elegant, high-productivity programming language.
Its syntax is based on Hagah, a derivative of Smalltalk with strong types. Swift++ is
implemented for the Swift ecosystem, so as Swift continues to move across platforms and
architectures, it will carry the seeds for Swift++ apps as well.

More details to follow, but now it's time to build stuff!
